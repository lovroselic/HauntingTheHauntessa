        But after the epic drama of “Princess Wants Everything,” seducing Ghosty to do her bidding in 
        “Castle Haunt,” she finally slipped on her high heels, tightened that ponytail, and took destiny 
        into her own hands. 
        She then outsmarted the paranormal pests led by GhostFace in “The Curse of the Castle Creep.” 
        Because honestly why let a pesky haunting or a teeny tiny curse stand between a girl 
        and absolutely everything she wants?`,

        find herself smack in the middle of another invasion. 
        Hauntessa Spookish, it turns out, doesn't do “forgive and forget.” She's unleashed an entire
        armada of Apparitias and ghosts on Castle Creep, all to avenge her dear cousin GhostFace. 
        Because really, what's a vengeful spirit if not punctual, persistent, and seriously peeved?`,

        venture into the Hauntingsphere and face Hauntessa Spookish once and for all.
         One on one—or, more likely, one against many, because Hauntessa definitely won't fight fair. 
         The Princess is already sharpening her sword (and her heels), ready to begin the final showdown. 
         Are you?`,
